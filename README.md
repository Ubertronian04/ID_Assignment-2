# ID Assignment 02: Mathematics Educational Web Application owo

This project is a collaborative effort between 3 students to create a math-centered, educational web application for children, aged 6-12, to smoothly interact and play with. The website's purpose is to give children an alternative way to learn and enjoy mathematics through the use of simple games. The contents of the website will include a login page, a testimonial page and a few simple games such as Sudoku.

If the guessed letter is in the word but not in the same position, the tile will be yellow. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the tile will be grey.
      if the guess word is the same as the word, the user will win the game.

   2. Science game:
      In the science game, there are 5 different topics, and the different topics will have different type of pictures for the user to guess. The user is prompted to guess the name of the picture using in-game keyboard. The user has a total of 6 chances to make a mistake. If a letter is guessed, the letter will not be able to press again. If the letter guessed is in the name of the picture, the letter will show in the exact same position as the letter in the name. Moreover, there is a reset button, upon pressing the game will reset and a new picture will show.

   3. Math game:

      Practice math game:
      In practice math, game users are given an equation but the answer of it will not be shown. On the right of the equation there is 3 answers for the user to choose but only 1 answer is the correct answer and user only have allow to make up to 3 wrong answer.Every right answer is make, the user will be award 1 points.
